# Project 1: Austria Inflation Analysis

Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, provides plenty of high-quality data on various topics. 
Driven by an interest in Austria’s inflation trends, I collected and analyzed data on inflation in Austria for the years 2016–2024 to uncover insights into how prices
evolved over these years.
