#Project 1: Austria Inflation Analysis
This is a project I built driven by interest in figuring out the impact of separate product categories on inflation rate in Austria.
For that purpose, I used datasets fetched from Eurostat website which is the statistical office of European Union that turned out to be very helpful for my goal.
